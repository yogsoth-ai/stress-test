# Adversarial Roleplay Tactic

Deploy constructed hostile personas to attack the artifact from distinct motivational frames.

## Orchestration

1. **persona-construction** builds detailed adversary profile:
   - Background and expertise domain
   - Motivation for attacking (career incentive, resource competition, ideological)
   - Known blind spots and biases of this persona type
   - Preferred attack patterns
2. **attack-vector-generation** generates vectors specific to persona's expertise and motivation
3. **probe-execution** executes attacks while maintaining persona consistency
4. Successful attack paths recorded with persona attribution
5. Process repeats for each persona (budget-limited)
6. **finding-aggregation** cross-references findings across personas for convergent vulnerabilities

## Subagents Dispatched

- persona-construction (1 call per persona)
- attack-vector-generation (1 call per persona)
- probe-execution (N calls per persona, budget-limited)
- finding-aggregation (1 call at end, cross-persona)

## Termination Conditions

- All budgeted personas deployed and exhausted
- Convergent vulnerability found by 2+ personas (high-confidence finding)
- Single persona finds critical vulnerability (early report)
- Budget exhausted (report per-persona findings separately)

## Available SOPs

Optional, no fixed order; the final leaf is always a sop.

| SOP | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| attack-vector-generation | Generate specific attack strategies for a given threat surface, producing concrete probes that can be executed. |
| finding-aggregation | Aggregate, deduplicate, and classify findings from multiple probes into a coherent vulnerability report. |
| persona-construction | Build a detailed adversarial persona with background, motivation, expertise, blind spots, and preferred attack patterns. |
| probe-execution | Execute a single attack probe against an artifact, record the result with evidence and severity classification. |
