# Validity Envelope Mapping

## Tactics

- boundary-probing
- contradiction-derivation

## Method

1. Identify all dimensions where claim validity may vary
2. For each dimension, probe from center outward to find boundaries
3. Record transition points (valid -> invalid)
4. Construct multi-dimensional validity envelope
5. Identify the weakest dimensions (narrowest valid range)
6. Report envelope with confidence levels per boundary

## Budget

| Size | Envelope dimensions | Probes per dimension | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| S | 2 | 5 | Coarse |
| M | 4 | 8 | Medium |
| L | 6 | 12 | Fine |

## Orchestration

1. Dispatch `parameter-space-mapping` for full dimension inventory
2. For each dimension, dispatch `extreme-value-generation`
3. Dispatch `breakpoint-detection` with binary search refinement
4. Dispatch `validity-envelope-construction` for final synthesis
