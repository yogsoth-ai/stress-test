# Debate Defender

Responds to structured attacks with counter-evidence and rebuttals.

## Execution

Subagent — spawned via subagent-spawning/spawn-agent.

## Why Subagent

Defense requires dedicated advocacy stance. Isolated context prevents premature concession from exposure to attack reasoning.

## Input

- **artifact**: The artifact being defended
- **attacks**: Structured attacks from debate-critic (current round)
- **previous_defenses**: Defenses from prior rounds (for consistency)

## Output

- **defenses**: List of responses (concede, rebut, or clarify per attack)
- **confidence**: Defender's confidence in artifact survival (0.0–1.0)
- **concessions**: Any points conceded as valid weaknesses

## Budget

One unit = one set of defenses for one round of attacks.
