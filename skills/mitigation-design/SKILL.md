# Mitigation Design Strategy

Design countermeasures for high-priority failure modes across three layers: prevention, detection, response.

## Method

1. **mitigation-design-sop** generates countermeasures for each H-priority failure:
   - Prevention: eliminate or reduce occurrence
   - Detection: improve ability to detect before impact
   - Response: contingency plan if failure occurs
2. **re-scoring** re-evaluates S/O/D with mitigations in place
3. **mitigation-validation** runs mini-FMEA on mitigations themselves
4. Iterate until all H-priority items reach M or L after mitigation

## Budget Table

| Parameter | S | M | L |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mitigations per failure mode | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| Re-scoring rounds | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| Mitigation validation depth | shallow | standard | full FMEA |

## Orchestration

```
[H-priority failures] → mitigation-design-sop
  → re-scoring → action-priority-matrix (re-classify)
  → [still H?] → mitigation-validation → iterate
  → [M or L?] → accept, document residual risk
```

## Subagents

- mitigation-design-sop (countermeasure generation)
- re-scoring (post-mitigation S/O/D)
- action-priority-matrix (re-classification)
