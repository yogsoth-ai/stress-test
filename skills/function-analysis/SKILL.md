# Function Analysis

Decomposes artifact into a hierarchical function tree per FMEA Step 3.

## Execution

Subagent — spawned via subagent-spawning/spawn-agent.

## Why Subagent

Function decomposition requires systematic analytical thinking without premature failure identification. Isolated context prevents jumping to conclusions.

## Input

- **artifact**: The artifact to decompose
- **artifact_type**: Type for tailored decomposition
- **analysis_mode**: "design" (what it should do) or "process" (how it executes)

## Output

- **function_tree**: Hierarchical list of functions and sub-functions
- **function_requirements**: What each function must achieve to succeed

## Available SOPs

Optional, no fixed order; the final leaf is always a sop.

| SOP | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| spawn-agent | Spawn a customized CC subagent with full MCP tool access. Used by SOPs that declare execution: subagent. |
