# Assumption Challenge Strategy

Military ACT (Analytic Confidence Testing): systematically surface and attack assumptions underlying the artifact.

## Method

1. **key-assumptions-check** enumerates all assumptions (explicit and implicit)
2. Assumptions sorted by criticality and evidence strength
3. **devils-advocacy** constructs strongest counter-argument for each critical assumption
4. Team A defends assumptions, Team B attacks — structured exchange
5. **assumption-cascade-tracer** maps dependency chains from root assumptions
6. Failed assumptions trigger cascade analysis to identify downstream impacts

## Budget Table

| Parameter | S | M | L |
|---|---|---|---|
| Attack vectors | 5 | 12 | 20 |
| Probing rounds | 3 | 6 | 10 |
| Personas | 2 | 4 | 6 |
| Assumption checks | 5 | 10 | 20 |

## Orchestration

```
key-assumptions-check → [enumerate and rank assumptions]
→ [for each critical assumption]:
    devils-advocacy (construct counter-argument)
    → probe-execution (test assumption)
    → assumption-cascade-tracer (map dependencies)
→ finding-aggregation → attack-resilience-scoring
```

## Subagents

- key-assumptions-check (enumeration and ranking)
- devils-advocacy (counter-argument construction)
- probe-execution (assumption testing)
- assumption-cascade-tracer (dependency mapping)
- finding-aggregation (result synthesis)

## Available Tactics

Optional, no fixed order; the final leaf is always a sop.

| Tactic | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| assumption-cascade | Tactic: Surface assumptions, sort by dependency, attack root assumptions first, then trace cascade failures through the dependency graph. |
| structured-attack-campaign | Tactic: Full attack lifecycle — threat surface enumeration, attack vector generation, systematic probing, and finding aggregation across all surfaces. |

## Available SOPs

Optional, no fixed order; the final leaf is always a sop.

| SOP | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| assumption-cascade-tracer | Build assumption dependency graphs and trace cascade failures when root assumptions are invalidated. |
| devils-advocacy | Construct the strongest possible counter-argument against a position, steelmanning the opposition before attacking. |
| finding-aggregation | Aggregate, deduplicate, and classify findings from multiple probes into a coherent vulnerability report. |
| key-assumptions-check | Military ACT: systematically enumerate all assumptions, classify by type, and evaluate evidence strength supporting each. |
| probe-execution | Execute a single attack probe against an artifact, record the result with evidence and severity classification. |
