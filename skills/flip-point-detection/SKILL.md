# Flip-Point Detection

Binary search for the minimal perturbation that reverses the conclusion.

## Execution

Subagent — spawned via subagent-spawning/spawn-agent.

## Why Subagent

Flip-point detection requires iterative reasoning about graduated changes, best done in isolated context.

## Input

- **artifact**: The original artifact
- **dimension**: The dimension to perturb along
- **conclusion**: The conclusion being tested

## Output

- **flip_point**: The minimal change that flips the conclusion
- **distance**: How far from actuality the flip-point is (0.0–1.0)
- **confidence**: Confidence in the flip-point location
- **search_path**: Steps taken to find the flip-point

## Budget

One unit = one binary search per dimension.
