# Load-Bearing Identification

Synthesizes ablation, necessity, and sufficiency results to identify critical factors.

## Execution

Subagent — spawned via subagent-spawning/spawn-agent.

## Why Subagent

Final synthesis requires weighing multiple evidence streams to produce a definitive ranking.

## Input

- **ablation_results**: Degradation scores from factor removal
- **necessity_scores**: PN scores per factor
- **sufficiency_scores**: PS scores per factor

## Output

- **load_bearing_factors**: Ranked list of critical factors
- **classification**: Each factor classified into necessity-sufficiency quadrant
- **confidence**: Confidence in each classification
- **summary**: Overall structural assessment

## Budget

One unit = one synthesis per campaign run.
