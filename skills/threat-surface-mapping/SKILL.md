# Threat Surface Mapping

Enumerates all surfaces of the artifact that could be attacked or challenged.

## Execution

Subagent — spawned via subagent-spawning/spawn-agent.

## Why Subagent

Surface enumeration requires systematic coverage without bias toward obvious attack points. Isolated context prevents premature focus on specific vulnerabilities.

## Input

- **artifact**: The complete artifact to analyze
- **artifact_type**: Type of artifact (hypothesis, claim, idea, approach, etc.)

## Output

- **surfaces**: List of threat surfaces with category, description, and attack accessibility rating
- **coverage_map**: Matrix of dimensions covered vs. uncovered
- **priority_ranking**: Surfaces ranked by expected vulnerability
