# Contradiction Derivation

## Orchestration Steps

1. Receive claim P from strategy
2. Dispatch `claim-negation` to produce ~P
3. Dispatch `deductive-chain` with ~P as premise, derive consequences
4. At each derivation step, dispatch `contradiction-detection` to check for:
   - Formal contradiction (Q and ~Q)
   - Absurd consequence (violates known facts)
   - Infinite regress or vacuous truth
5. If contradiction found: report with derivation trace
6. If chain exhausts without contradiction: report claim as contingent

## Subagents

- claim-negation
- deductive-chain
- contradiction-detection

## Termination Conditions

- Genuine contradiction detected (success)
- Maximum derivation depth reached (inconclusive)
- Circular reasoning detected (abort with warning)
- Budget exhausted (report partial results)

## Available SOPs

Optional, no fixed order; the final leaf is always a sop.

| SOP | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| claim-negation | Formally negate the core claim, producing the logical complement for reductio testing. |
| contradiction-detection | Evaluate whether a derivation chain has reached a genuine contradiction, absurdity, or inconclusive state. |
| deductive-chain | Derive logical consequences step by step from a given premise, building a traceable derivation chain. |
