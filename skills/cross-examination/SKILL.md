# Cross-Examination

Probes defender responses for inconsistencies and logical gaps.

## Execution

Subagent — spawned via subagent-spawning/spawn-agent.

## Why Subagent

Cross-examination requires fresh analytical perspective on the defense — isolated context prevents anchoring to either attack or defense framing.

## Input

- **defenses**: Structured defenses from debate-defender
- **attacks**: Original attacks that prompted the defenses
- **artifact**: The artifact being debated (for reference)

## Output

- **probes**: List of follow-up questions targeting defense weaknesses
- **inconsistencies**: Contradictions found within or between defenses
- **unsupported_claims**: Defense claims lacking evidence
- **verdict_suggestion**: Whether defense held up under examination

## Budget

One unit = one cross-examination pass per round.
