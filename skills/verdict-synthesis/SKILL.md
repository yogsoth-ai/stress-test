# Verdict Synthesis

Synthesizes campaign findings into typed verdict reports.

## Execution

Subagent — spawned via subagent-spawning/spawn-agent.

## Why Subagent

Synthesis requires processing all strategy/tactic outputs from a campaign in dedicated context to produce coherent final report.

## Input

- **campaign_name**: Which campaign produced these findings
- **strategy_outputs**: All strategy and tactic outputs from the campaign
- **weakness_classifications**: Classified weaknesses (from weakness-classification)

## Output

Typed report matching campaign:
- `DebateVerdict` (multiagent-debate)
- `RedTeamReport` (red-teaming)
- `FailureAnticipationReport` (failure-anticipation)
- `CounterfactualMap` (counterfactual-probing)
- `AdversarialStressReport` (adversarial-stress-testing)
- `StressTestSummary` (cross-campaign aggregation)

## Budget

One unit = one synthesis pass producing a complete typed report.
