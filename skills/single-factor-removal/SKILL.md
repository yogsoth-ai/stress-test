# Single Factor Removal

Ablation unit: removes one factor and reasons about conclusion stability.

## Execution

Subagent — spawned via subagent-spawning/spawn-agent.

## Why Subagent

Each removal must be reasoned about independently to avoid contamination from other removal results.

## Input

- **artifact**: The original artifact
- **factor_to_remove**: Which factor to remove
- **factors_list**: All factors (for context of what remains)

## Output

- **conclusion_before**: Original conclusion status
- **conclusion_after**: Conclusion status without this factor
- **degradation_score**: 0.0 (no effect) to 1.0 (collapse)
- **reasoning**: Why the conclusion is/isn't affected

## Budget

One unit = one factor removal per invocation.
