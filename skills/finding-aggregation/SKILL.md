# Finding Aggregation

Synthesizes findings from multiple attack probes into a coherent, deduplicated report.

## Execution

Subagent — spawned via subagent-spawning/spawn-agent.

## Why Subagent

Aggregation requires neutral analytical stance — neither inflating nor minimizing findings. The aggregator must see patterns across individual probe results.

## Input

- **findings**: All probe results from the campaign
- **attack_metadata**: Metadata about attack coverage (surfaces hit, vectors used, personas deployed)

## Output

- **vulnerabilities**: Deduplicated list classified by severity and type
- **patterns**: Cross-cutting patterns observed across multiple probes
- **coverage_gaps**: Surfaces or dimensions not adequately tested
- **recommendations**: Prioritized hardening actions
