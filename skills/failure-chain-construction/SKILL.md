# Failure Chain Construction

Builds multi-level cause → mode → effect chains for systemic failure understanding.

## Execution

Subagent — spawned via subagent-spawning/spawn-agent.

## Why Subagent

Chain construction requires disciplined causal reasoning without skipping levels. Isolated context prevents shortcutting.

## Input

- **failure_modes**: Structured failure mode catalog
- **function_tree**: Function decomposition for context
- **depth**: Max chain depth (2/4/6 per budget)

## Output

- **chains**: List of cause-mode-effect chains with level annotations
- **shared_causes**: Root causes appearing in multiple chains
- **cascade_risks**: Modes that trigger other modes
