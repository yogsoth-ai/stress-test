# Mitigation Proposal

Proposes concrete mitigation strategies for identified weaknesses.

## Execution

Subagent — spawned via subagent-spawning/spawn-agent.

## Why Subagent

Mitigation design requires creative problem-solving in dedicated context, separate from the attack/discovery mindset.

## Input

- **classified_weakness**: The weakness with severity classification
- **artifact_context**: The original artifact context

## Output

- **prevention_measures**: What changes prevent this weakness
- **detection_mechanisms**: What checks catch this earlier
- **response_actions**: What contingency limits damage
- **feasibility_assessment**: How practical are these mitigations
- **residual_risk**: What risk remains after mitigation

## Constraint

Stop at proposal — do NOT modify the original artifact. Suggestions only.

## Budget

One unit = one mitigation proposal per weakness. Focus on fatal and major findings.

## Available SOPs

Optional, no fixed order; the final leaf is always a sop.

| SOP | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| spawn-agent | Spawn a customized CC subagent with full MCP tool access. Used by SOPs that declare execution: subagent. |
