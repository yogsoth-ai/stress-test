# Action Priority Matrix

Computes RPN and classifies failure modes into High/Medium/Low action priority.

## Execution

Subagent — spawned via subagent-spawning/spawn-agent.

## Why Subagent

Priority classification requires mechanical computation followed by judgment on borderline cases. Isolated context ensures consistent application of thresholds.

## Input

- **severity_scores**: S scores for all failure modes
- **occurrence_scores**: O scores for all failure modes
- **detection_scores**: D scores for all failure modes

## Output

- **priority_matrix**: Full table with S, O, D, RPN, and H/M/L classification
- **action_required**: H-priority items requiring mandatory mitigation
- **borderline_cases**: Items near threshold boundaries

## Available SOPs

Optional, no fixed order; the final leaf is always a sop.

| SOP | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| spawn-agent | Spawn a customized CC subagent with full MCP tool access. Used by SOPs that declare execution: subagent. |
