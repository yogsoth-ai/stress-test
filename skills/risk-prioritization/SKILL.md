# Risk Prioritization Strategy

Classifies failure modes into High/Medium/Low action priority using severity-weighted S/O/D scoring.

## Method

1. Collect S/O/D scores from upstream FMEA analysis
2. **action-priority-matrix** applies AIAG-VDA Action Priority logic:
   - H (High): Mandatory action required — severity >= 8, or combined S*O >= 36
   - M (Medium): Action recommended — moderate risk combinations
   - L (Low): Optional action — acceptable risk level
3. Rank all failure modes by priority class, then by RPN within class
4. Feed H-priority items to mitigation-design strategy

## Budget Table

| Parameter | S | M | L |
|---|---|---|---|
| Failure modes classified | 8 | 20 | 40 |
| Priority threshold tuning | fixed | 1 round | 2 rounds |
| Sensitivity analysis | none | top-5 | full |

## Orchestration

```
[S/O/D scores from upstream] → action-priority-matrix
  → priority-ranked failure catalog
  → [H-priority items] → mitigation-design
```

## Subagents

- action-priority-matrix (RPN computation and H/M/L classification)
- severity-scoring (re-evaluation if needed)
